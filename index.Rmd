## Animated GIF creation

```{r class.source = "pink_back",  echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

## Learning Reflection

Before Module 1 I had extremely limited experience in HTML/CSS. I have used R for a couple of years, but only ever for statistical analysis, and I hadn't realised how great an opportunity there was within R markdown to customise and personalise data. I am really excited to use these new skills to make my future assignments and work projects pop! I would be interested in further exploring how to integrate python into markdown, since I regularly use R and Python, and this would allow me to bring together the different projects I am working on into a single presentation. The module has also encouraged me to further develop my GitHub profile and try building my own website. I believe the ideas from this module have helped me to better understand how and where different technologies can come together, making it much easier and more exciting to share data.
